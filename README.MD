# SQL Syntax Practice ðŸ“˜

This repository contains my hands-on practice with SQL syntax, designed to reinforce key concepts while learning SQL from scratch.

## Whatâ€™s Included

- `CREATE TABLE`, `DROP TABLE`
- `INSERT INTO`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`
- `SELECT` statements and filtering
- Aggregate functions: `MIN()`, `MAX()`
- Table joins: `INNER JOIN`, `LEFT JOIN`, `RIGHT JOIN`
- Relationships between `Users` and `Orders`

##  What I Learned

- How to define and manipulate tables in a relational database
- How to modify and query data using SQL commands
- The use of aggregate functions to extract meaningful insights
- The role of different types of `JOIN` in combining related data
- Troubleshooting and testing SQL queries step by step

##  Extra Context

I first wrote the entire SQL syntax by hand in a notebook to help me understand the logic better.  
Then I tested the more complex parts â€” like `JOIN`s, conditions, and aggregates â€” directly on my laptop using SQLite to verify and correct my understanding.

##  Purpose

This was my personal SQL learning playground â€” a space to test everything from basic to intermediate-level SQL logic before building full projects.
